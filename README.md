# ML Model for S&P 500 Price Prediction

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER
**This project is strictly educational in nature.** The models implemented here are basic demonstrations intended to illustrate fundamental machine learning concepts rather than provide accurate market predictions. They serve as learning tools, not financial advisory instruments. In fact, these models are deliberately simplified and would not perform well in real-world trading scenarios!

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates simple machine learning approaches to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 index. It serves as an **educational exploration** of basic data science concepts, with implementations that are deliberately straightforward to highlight fundamental principles.

> **Personal note:** These models have about as much chance of accurately predicting tomorrow's S&P 500 as a weather forecast has of being 100% accurate a month from now! They're meant to teach concepts, not make you rich. That said, they're yours to improve upon - consider them your "starter kit" for more sophisticated approaches.

The implementation focuses on three prediction models - **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **K-means clustering** - which are applied to historical S&P 500 data enhanced with technical indicators. All concepts used in this project are documented in the `Learning_Resources` directory for reference.

## 🎓 **How to Approach This Project**

I recommend the following **learning path**:

1. **📚 Start with the basics:** First, review the learning materials in the `Learning_Resources` directory to understand the fundamental concepts
2. **🔧 Explore the simpler implementations:** Begin with the basic examples in each model's Examples directory
3. **🤖 Study the full implementations:** Move on to the more complete implementations to see how concepts come together
4. **🚀 Experiment and modify:** This is where real learning happens! Try changing parameters, adding features, or implementing your own approaches
5. **📊 Compare and contrast:** Analyze the differences between models and their performance metrics

**Remember:** The goal is **NOT** to create a perfect prediction model, but to understand how these algorithms work with financial data. This is a **learning journey**, not a trading strategy!

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

To run these models:

1. **🐍 Environment:** Ensure you have Python 3.x and the necessary libraries installed
2. **📥 Clone:** Clone this repository
3. **📚 Learn:** Start with the `Learning_Resources` directory
4. **🔧 Run:** Execute the model scripts in their respective directories
5. **📊 Analyze:** Use the Jupyter notebooks for exploration

## 🔧 **How to Run**

1. **📥 Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **📁 Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Intro-To-ML-SP500-Prediction
   ```

3. **📦 Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **🚀 Run the desired model script. For example:**
   ```bash
   # Linear Regression example
   python Regression_Models/Linear_Regression/Examples/LR_Guided_Eexample.py
   
   # K-means clustering
   python Clustering/K-means.py

   python Ensemble_Models/Examples/RF_Guided_Example.py
   ```

5. **📊 Explore with Jupyter notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/
   ```

## Further Experimentation

These models are intentionally basic to highlight fundamental principles. Consider experimenting with:
- Additional technical indicators
- Feature selection techniques
- Hyperparameter optimization
- More sophisticated models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks
