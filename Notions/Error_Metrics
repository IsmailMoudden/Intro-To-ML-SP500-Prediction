# Error Metrics

### **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**  
MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.  
- **Formula:**  
  MSE = (1/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²  
  where:  
  - n is the number of data points  
  - yᵢ is the actual value  
  - ŷᵢ is the predicted value  
- **Purpose:** A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.  

### **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides an error metric in the same units as the target variable.  
- **Formula:**  
   RMSE = √MSE = √[(1/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²]  
  where:  
  - n is the number of data points  
  - yᵢ is the actual value  
  - ŷᵢ is the predicted value 
- **Purpose:** RMSE is often preferred because it is easier to interpret in the context of the original data.
