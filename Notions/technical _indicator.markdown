# Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are essential tools in financial analysis, providing insights into market momentum, trend direction, and potential reversal points. Below are some of the most commonly used indicators:

---

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

- **Description:**  
  A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
  
- **Purpose:**  
  Helps determine overbought or oversold conditions in the market.

- **Typical Window:**  
  14 days.

- **Usage:**  
  When the RSI exceeds a certain level (commonly 70), it suggests that the asset may be overbought, whereas an RSI below 30 indicates that it may be oversold.

## MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

- **Description:**  
  A trend-following momentum indicator that reveals the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.

- **Purpose:**  
  Helps identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.

- **Calculation:**  
  - **MACD Line:** Difference between a 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a 26-day EMA.
  - **Signal Line:** A 9-day EMA of the MACD line.
  
- **Usage:**  
  Crossovers between the MACD line and the signal line can indicate potential buy or sell signals.

## SMA (Simple Moving Average)

- **Description:**  
  A straightforward indicator that calculates the average of a security’s closing prices over a specified number of days.

- **Purpose:**  
  Smooths out price fluctuations to make it easier to identify underlying trends.

- **Calculation:**  
  SMA = (Sum of Closing Prices over N Days) / N  
  *For example, a 20-day SMA averages the closing prices over the last 20 days.*

- **Common Uses:**  
  - **Short-term Trends:**  
    A 20-day SMA is typically used to gauge short-term price trends.
  - **Long-term Trends:**  
    Longer SMAs, such as the 50-day or 100-day SMA, help in identifying longer-term trends.
