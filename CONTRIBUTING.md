# 🤝 Contributing to S&P 500 Prediction Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this educational machine learning project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## **Project Goals**

This project aims to:
- **Educate** users about machine learning in financial markets
- **Provide** practical examples of ML algorithms
- **Demonstrate** best practices in data science
- **Create** a learning resource for the community

## **How to Contribute**

### **1. Report Bugs**
- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/Intro-To-ML-SP500-Prediction/issues) page
- Include a clear description of the problem
- Provide steps to reproduce the issue
- Include your environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)

### **2. Suggest Enhancements**
- Open a new issue with the "enhancement" label
- Describe the feature you'd like to see
- Explain why this would be beneficial
- Provide examples if possible

### **3. Submit Code Changes**
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
- Make your changes
- Add tests if applicable
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
- Open a Pull Request

##  **Contribution Guidelines**

### **Code Style**
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### **Documentation**
- Update README files when adding new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update learning resources if adding new concepts
- Use clear, concise language

### **Testing**
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Test with different Python versions if possible
- Include edge cases in your tests

### **Commit Messages**
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add more details in the body if needed

**Good examples:**
```
Add support for additional technical indicators
Fix data pipeline memory leak issue
Update documentation with new examples
```

**Bad examples:**
```
stuff
fix
update
```
