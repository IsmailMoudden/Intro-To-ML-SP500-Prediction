# Technical Indicators

RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) are two popular technical indicators used in financial analysis:

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)** 
It is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
Purpose: Helps determine overbought or oversold market conditions.
Typical Window: 14 days.

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
Purpose: Helps identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
Typical Calculation: Difference between a 12-day EMA and a 26-day EMA, with a 9-day EMA of the MACD serving as a signal line.
