# Technical Indicators

RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) are two popular technical indicators used in financial analysis:

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)** 
It is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
Purpose: Helps determine overbought or oversold market conditions.
Typical Window: 14 days.

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.
Purpose: Helps identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
Typical Calculation: Difference between a 12-day EMA and a 26-day EMA, with a 9-day EMA of the MACD serving as a signal line.

## **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**  
The SMA is a technical indicator that calculates the average of a security’s closing prices over a specific number of days.  
- Purpose:Smooths out price fluctuations to identify trends more easily.  
- Calculation:
  SMA = (Sum of Closing Prices over N Days) / N
  For example, a 20-day SMA averages the closing prices of the last 20 days.  

- Common Uses: 
  - Short-term SMAs (e.g., 20-day) are used to identify short-term trends.  
  - Long-term SMAs (e.g., 50-day, 100-day) are used to identify long-term trends.
