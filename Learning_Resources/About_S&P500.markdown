# About the S&P 500

The **S&P 500** (Standard & Poor's 500) is one of the most widely followed stock market indices in the world. It represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States.

## Key Concepts

### **What is the S&P 500?**

- The S&P 500 is a **market capitalization-weighted index**, meaning that companies with larger market caps have a greater influence on the index's value.
- It is often used as a benchmark for the overall performance of the U.S. stock market and the economy.

### **How does it work?**

- The index is calculated based on the market capitalization of its 500 constituent companies.  
- **Market Capitalization** = Stock Price Ã— Number of Outstanding Shares.
- The value of the S&P 500 is updated in real-time during market hours as the prices of the constituent stocks change.

### **What does a "point" in the S&P 500 represent?**

- A **point** in the S&P 500 represents a unit of change in the index's value.  
  For example:
  - If the S&P 500 moves from 4,000 to 4,010, it has increased by **10 points**.
  - This change reflects the combined movement of the stock prices of all 500 companies in the index.

### **What does the value of the S&P 500 represent?**

- The value of the S&P 500 is not expressed in dollars or any other currency. Instead, it is a **weighted average** of the stock prices of the 500 companies in the index.
- For example:
  If the S&P 500 is at **4,000 points**, it means the combined market capitalization of the 500 companies has reached a specific weighted value.
